# Pansift Instructions

Pansift is under heavy development and this will get simpler over time.

## To Install

You will need `git` installed for this method of install until we have a native OSX installer. Just type `git` in your terminal and if you don't have `git` installed then OSX should offer to install (or try `xcode-select --install`) to ensure you have the command line tools.

Then from your CLI / command line in OSX:

`cd /tmp && git clone https://github.com/pansift/p3.git && cd p3 && ./installer.sh`

*Note:* Everything is transparent so feel free to take a wander round the scripts and suggest improvements to any and all jankiness!
