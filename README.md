# Pansift Instructions

Pansift is under heavy development and this will get simpler over time.

## To Install

You will need `git` installed for this method of install until we have a native OSX installer. Just type `git` in your terminal and if you don't have git installed then OSX should offer to install (or try `xcode-select --instal`) to ensure you have the command line tools.

Then from your CLI / command line in OSX

`cd /tmp && git clone https://github.com/pansift/p3.git && cd p3 && ./installer.sh`
