# Intro 

Pansift is a Mac OSX laptop network and system monitoring tool. It is for those who support others **remotely** and enables them to rapidly find and fix issues (especially WiFi related). Whether you are a family member doing Zoom calls, a developer, or gamer who can't afford to be disconnected, interrupted, or slowed down, Pansift makes the invisible visible for a quick fix.

Pansift is about helping others to stay sane and productive with optimally functioning tools. It's about saving you time, maintaining situational awareness, and getting to root causes quickly and **remotely** even with historical issues. Whether it's WiFi problems, DNS latency, IPv4 vs IPv6, or simple disk utilization issues - PanSift allows you to keep an eye on many remote machines (just like server monitoring) only more lightweight, heavily wireless focused, and more user-friendly.
