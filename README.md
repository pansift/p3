# Pansift Intro 

Pansift is a Mac OSX laptop network and system monitoring tool. It is for those who support others **remotely** and enables them to rapidly find and fix issues (especially WiFi related). Whether you are a family member doing Zoom calls, a developer, or gamer who can't afford to be disconnected, interrupted, or slowed down, Pansift makes the invisible visible for a quick fix.

Pansift is about helping others to stay sane and productive with optimally functioning tools. It's about saving you time, maintaining situational awareness, and getting to root causes quickly and **remotely** even with historical issues. Whether it's WiFi problems, DNS latency, IPv4 vs IPv6, or simple disk utilization issues, PanSift allows you to keep an eye on many machines just like server monitoring only more lightweight and user-friendly.

## Install Instructions (Alpha)

**Note:** Currently the official web front-end is not ready but you can get an account on the intermediate dashboard by contacting `support@pansift.com` with your `UUID` from the app. This is only intended for more technical people (who can also use the terminal for any debugging) i.e. to install on their own or other's machines.

```
**Download this [Pansift DMG](https://github.com/pansift/p3/raw/main/Pansift.dmg), double click (open) it, and drag `Pansift.app` to the Applications folder and run (open) it**
```

*Note:* This repository is where the updates for scripts come from so you can see all the important internals. Feel free to suggest improvements or raise issues and PRs to any and all jankiness!

**P.S.** If you'd like access to the intermediate dashboards below (i.e. the front end final product is still being built) then email `support@pansift.com` with your Pansift `UUID` for access to something like the below. Please understand this is still a _Work In Progress_, and it's not yet production ready (there is much change happening, so your data might not be there tomorrow)! Only embark if you're a willing alpha tester and are confident enough to check the uninstall scripts to spot any rrors :)
