# Intro 

Pansift is a macOS troubleshooting and monitoring tool with a focus on the network. It is for those who support others **remotely** and enables them to rapidly find and fix issues (especially WiFi related). Whether you are a family member doing Zoom calls, a developer, a salesperson, or a gamer who can't afford to be disconnected, interrupted, or slowed down, Pansift makes the invisible visible for a quick fix.

Pansift is about helping others to avoid stress and stay productive with optimally functioning tools and networks. It's about saving you time, maintaining situational awareness, and getting to root causes quickly, easily, and **remotely** (even for historical issues). Whether it's for WiFi, DNS, IPv4, IPv6, or simple disk utilization issues - PanSift allows you to keep an eye on multiple remote machines (just like server monitoring) only with a more lightweight, heavily wireless focused, and user-friendly footprint.
