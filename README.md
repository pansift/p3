# Pansift Instructions

##### Temp file for now but basically aligning with OSX default file structure and adding installer.sh file

## To Install

You will need "git" installed for this method of install until we have a native OSX installer. Just type `git` in your terminal and if you don't have git installed then OSX should offer to install (or try `xcode-select --instal`) to ensure you have the command line tools.

Then from your CLI / command line in OSX

`cd /tmp && git clone https://github.com/pansift/p3.git && cd p3 && ./installer.sh`
